# GeoFire for Android/Java â€” Realtime location queries with Firebase

GeoFire is an open-source library for Android/Java that allows you to store and
query a set of items based on their geographic location.

GeoFire uses [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) for data storage, allowing
query results to be updated in realtime as they change.  GeoFire does more than
just measure the distance between locations; *it selectively loads only the
data near certain locations, keeping your applications light and responsive*,
even with extremely large datasets.
